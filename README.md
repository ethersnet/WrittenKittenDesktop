# Written Kitten Desktop

Inspired by [Written? Kitten!](https://github.com/joshuawalcher/writtenkitten) but made into a script made to run on Linux.
When started, a window will pop up that tracks words written, showing a new cat every 100 words. It will track words no matter where they are typed, so you can use it with applications such as Libre Office, or web applications like Google Docs.

# Set-Up

```
cd WrittenKittenDesktop
python -m venv
venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo venv/bin/python3 writtenkitten.py
```
